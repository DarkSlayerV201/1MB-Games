# 1MB Games

## Overview
1MB Games is a personal web project created as my first Front-End experience.  
It started as a project for my Front-End course at *Talento Tech* and later evolved into a space to experiment with web technologies.

The website is intended to showcase small videogame projects and, in the future, allow users to submit their own games through an interactive form.
